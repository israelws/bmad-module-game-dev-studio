# BMGD - BMAD Method for Game Development

![](docs/bmgd-logo.png)

BMAD Method for Game Development (BMGD) brings the power of BMAD's project planning and structured development to game development. Create working prototypes quickly in three of the industry's leading 3D engines (Unity, Unreal, and Godot) or whatever platform you like. BMGD will lead you through product research, technical design, narrative design, and a full epic-driven production cycle, developed by game industry veterans off of BMAD Method's core.

Sound like *too much* power? You can also use BMGD to quickly prototype an idea, skipping most of the planning steps and going straight into breaking things in your engine of choice!

## What can BMGD do?

BMGD, out of the box, contains support for game development and testing in:

* [Unity](https://unity.com)
* [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/)
* [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

 However, these engines *aren't a requirement* - if you want to make a roguelike in pure C, BMGD can handle it.  The BMGD process will guide you through every step of creating a game project, all the way to release.

As for what kind of games you can create? BMGD has support for *21* game types, from turn-based strategy to visual novels to survival games. And if your game idea doesn't fit in any one of those, that's fine, too.

## What can't BMGD do?

With very few simple exceptions, *BMGD cannot create an entire game from scratch for you.* 

BMGD is designed to work with *coding agents* such as Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, or Github Copilot. There are *many* aspects of game development that are outside the scope of these agents - such as art assets such as models and textures, animations, music, and sound effects. BMGD can work to integrate these into your chosen engine, but it *can't* create them. 

As such, it's designed to be part of your development team, not a one-stop solution for creating a game.

## What do I need to do to begin?

* Follow this walkthrough TODO! to install BMGD and create your first project.
* Read this tutorial TODO! on using Quick-Dev to create a prototype quickly
* Consult the tomes of documentation TODO! on all the functionality BMGD has to offer.

## This is a lot! Can I get some help?

Absolutely! The best place to get help is on our friendly BMAD Method Discord. There's a specific BMGD forum (link TODO!!) where the developers and other BMGD users will be glad to help out!

*BMGD - If you can dream it, you can do it.*
