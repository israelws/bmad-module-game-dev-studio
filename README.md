## About BMGD

BMad Game Dev Studio (BMGD) adapts the BMad Method framework for game development. Developed by game industry veterans, BMGD guides you through product research, technical design, narrative design, and a full epic-driven production cycle.

## Supported Engines

BMGD has first-class support for:

- [Unity](https://unity.com) — C# scripting, industry-standard for many game types
- [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) — Blueprint and C++, AAA powerhouse
- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) — Open-source, GDScript, rapidly growing

But you're not limited to these—BMGD works with any platform, from pure C to custom engines.

## What You Can Create

BMGD supports **21 game types**, including:

| Genre | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| Action | Platformers, shooters, hack-and-slash |
| RPG | Action RPG, tactical RPG, dungeon crawlers |
| Strategy | Turn-based, RTS, tower defense |
| Simulation | Life sim, tycoon, management |
| Adventure | Visual novels, point-and-click, walking simulators |
| And more... | Survival, horror, puzzle, racing, etc. |

## What BMGD Does

- **Product Research** — Market analysis, competitor research, positioning
- **Game Design Document** — Comprehensive GDD with mechanics, progression, and balance
- **Narrative Design** — Story structure, characters, dialogue, world-building
- **Technical Architecture** — Engine patterns, performance considerations
- **Production Planning** — Epic-driven sprints, story tracking, retrospectives
- **Quick Prototyping** — Skip the planning, jump straight into building

## What BMGD Doesn't Do

BMGD works *with* coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot—but it can't create everything:

- Art assets (models, textures, sprites)
- Animations
- Music and sound effects
- Full game implementation from scratch

Think of BMGD as your senior game dev colleague—not a replacement for your entire team.

## Installation

BMGD is installed as a module during BMad Method setup:

```bash
npx bmad-method@alpha install
```

Select **Game Dev Studio** from the modules list.

## Quick Start

After installing, run from your project root:

```
/bmad-help          # Get guided help for game development
/bmgd-quick-dev     # Jump straight into prototyping
/bmgd-gdd           # Create a Game Design Document
/bmgd-narrative     # Design your game's story
```

## Two Ways to Work

| Approach | When to Use | Workflow |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Quick Flow** | Rapid prototyping, small projects | `/bmgd-quick-dev` |
| **Full Production** | Full games, teams, long-term | `/bmad-help` for guided path |

## Example: Starting a New Game

```
You: /bmad-help
BMGD: What kind of game are you making?
You: A tactical sci-fi RPG
BMGD: Great choice! Here's what I recommend...
    [Guides you through genre-specific planning]
    [Helps select appropriate workflows]
```
