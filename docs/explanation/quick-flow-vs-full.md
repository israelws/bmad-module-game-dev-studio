# Quick Flow vs Full Production

BMad Game Dev Studio offers two development approaches. Understanding the difference helps you choose the right path for your project.

---

## Quick Flow

**Fast iteration for solo developers and small teams.**

Quick Flow is designed for rapid prototyping and quick iteration. It's ideal when you want to test ideas fast or ship a small project quickly.

### When to Use Quick Flow

- You're working **alone** or with a **tiny team**
- You want to **test a game mechanic** before committing
- You're building a **small prototype** or game jam entry
- Speed matters more than comprehensive documentation
- You're comfortable making decisions as you go

### What Quick Flow Looks Like

```
Idea → Quick Prototype → Play → Iterate → Ship
```

**No lengthy planning phases.** You jump straight into building, test early, and refine based on what's fun.

### The Quick Flow Workflow

Quick Flow uses the **Game Solo Dev (Indie)** agent, who specializes in rapid development:

1. **Quick Prototype** — Define your core mechanic and generate a prototype structure
2. **Quick Dev** — Implement features directly with game-specific guidance
3. **Quick Spec** — Generate a technical spec when you need one (optional)

### What You Get

- A playable prototype in **hours, not days**
- Minimal documentation (just what you need)
- Fast feedback loop with playtesting
- Flexibility to pivot based on what works

### When to Skip Quick Flow

- You have a **larger team** that needs coordination
- You're working with **publishers or stakeholders** who require formal documentation
- The project needs to be **maintained long-term** by multiple developers
- You need to track **sprints, stories, and epics** formally

---

## Full Production

**Structured development for teams and long-term projects.**

Full Production follows a complete game development pipeline from concept through production. It's ideal for larger projects and teams.

### When to Use Full Production

- You have a **team** with multiple disciplines (design, code, art)
- You need **formal documentation** for stakeholders or publishers
- The project will be **maintained or expanded** over time
- You want to track progress through **sprints and stories**
- You're building something **larger than a prototype**

### What Full Production Looks Like

```
Preproduction → Design → Technical → Production (sprints/stories)
```

**Each phase has specific workflows and artifacts.** Progress is tracked through sprints, stories, and retrospectives.

### The Full Production Workflow

Full Production uses specialized agents for each phase:

| Phase | Agent | Workflows | Outputs |
|-------|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Preproduction** | Game Designer | brainstorm-game, game-brief | game-brief.md |
| **Design** | Game Designer | create-gdd, narrative | gdd.md, narrative.md |
| **Technical** | Game Architect | create-architecture, project-context | architecture.md, project-context.md |
| **Production** | Game Scrum Master | sprint-planning, create-story | sprint-status.yaml, stories/ |
| **Implementation** | Game Developer | dev-story, code-review | Completed features |
| **Testing** | Game QA | test-framework, automate | Test suites, test results |

### What You Get

- **Complete documentation** — Game brief, GDD, architecture, technical specs
- **Sprint tracking** — sprint-status.yaml with stories, progress, and risks
- **Story management** — Clearly defined features with acceptance criteria
- **Project context** — AI-aware context file for consistency across all workflows
- **Retrospective process** — Continuous improvement for the team

### When to Skip Full Production

- You're **working alone** and don't need formal process
- You just want to **test an idea quickly**
- Documentation would **slow you down** more than it helps
- The project is a **one-off prototype** or experiment

## Comparison at a Glance

| Aspect | Quick Flow | Full Production |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Team size** | Solo or tiny team | Any size |
| **Speed** | Fast — prototype in hours | Thorough — planning takes time |
| **Documentation** | Minimal (prototype spec) | Comprehensive (brief, GDD, architecture) |
| **Tracking** | None (or informal) | Sprints, stories, retrospectives |
| **Agents involved** | Game Solo Dev (Indie) | All 6 agents as needed |
| **Best for** | Prototypes, jams, small projects | Full games, teams, publishers |
| **Time to first playable** | Hours to days | Days to weeks |

## Can You Switch Between Paths?

**Yes.** Quick Flow and Full Production aren't locked doors — they're different approaches to the same goal.

### Quick Flow → Full Production

Started with Quick Flow and now need more structure? No problem.

- Your prototype becomes the foundation for your **Game Brief**
- Iterate on your core mechanic in the **GDD phase**
- Use your prototype to inform the **Architecture**

The work you've done in Quick Flow informs the Full Production planning.

### Full Production → Quick Flow

In the middle of Full Production but need to test something quickly?

- Use Indie's **Quick Dev** workflow for rapid implementation
- Return to your **sprint planning** when ready

Full Production doesn't forbid Quick Flow workflows — it provides structure around them.

## Making Your Choice

**Still unsure?** Start with Quick Flow.

Quick Flow gets you to a playable prototype faster. If your project grows, you can transition to Full Production with your prototype as the foundation.

**Remember:** A playable prototype beats a perfect design document. Test early, ship often.
