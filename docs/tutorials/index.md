## Game Development Phases

BMGD follows four phases aligned with game development:

### Phase 1: Preproduction
- Brainstorm Game — Ideation with game-specific techniques
- Game Brief — Capture vision, market, and fundamentals

- Story Development — Implementation workflow
- Code Review — Quality assurance
- Testing — Automated tests, playtesting, performance
- Retrospective — Continuous improvement
