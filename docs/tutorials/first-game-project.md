# Your first game project with BMGD

Welcome to BMad Game Dev Studio (BMGD)! This tutorial will guide you through creating your first playable game prototype using BMGD's Quick Flow workflow.

## What you'll learn

- How BMGD's Quick Flow works for rapid prototyping
- Using Indie (Game Solo Dev) to accelerate development
- Creating your first playable game prototype from concept to test

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **BMad Method installed** with the BMGD module enabled
- **Basic familiarity** with game development concepts
- **A game engine installed** (Unity, Unreal, or Godot) — or you can follow along conceptually

---

## Step 1: Start your prototype

Begin by invoking the Quick Flow workflow. In your BMad-enabled environment, run:

```
/bmgd-quick-prototype
```

This summons **Indie** (the Game Solo Dev agent), who specializes in rapid prototyping and fast iteration.

Indie will ask you about your game concept. Don't worry if you only have a rough idea — that's perfect for Quick Flow.

---

## Step 2: Choose your game type

BMGD supports **24 game types**, each with specialized templates. Indie will help you select the one that fits your concept.

Common game types include:

| Game Type | Description | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Action Platformer | Jump, run, and overcome obstacles | Mario, Celeste |
| Puzzle | Solve challenges using logic | Tetris, Portal |
| RPG | Character progression and narrative | Final Fantasy, Undertale |
| Shooter | Combat through projectiles | Doom, Halo |
| Survival | Manage resources and stay alive | Minecraft, Don't Starve |

If you're unsure, describe your idea and Indie will recommend the best fit.

## Step 3: Define your core mechanic

Every great game centers on a **core mechanic** — the primary action players repeat throughout the game.

Indie will guide you to define:

- **The action:** What does the player do? (jump, shoot, match, build...)
- **The goal:** What is the player trying to achieve?
- **The challenge:** What makes it difficult or interesting?

**Example:** For a platformer, your core mechanic might be "jumping between platforms while avoiding enemies to reach the goal."

Keep it simple. Quick Flow is about testing ideas fast, not building everything at once.

---

## Step 4: Generate the prototype

Once you've defined your core mechanic, Indie generates your initial prototype structure:

- **Prototype specification** — What you're building and how it works
- **Basic game loop** — The core repeatable experience
- **Asset placeholders** — What art and audio you'll need
- **Next steps** — How to iterate and improve

This is your starting point. It's not a complete game — it's a **playable foundation** you can build on.

---

## Step 5: Review and iterate

Now the fun part: **playtest your prototype.**

Ask yourself:

- Is the core mechanic fun?
- Does the game loop feel satisfying?
- What's missing or confusing?

Quick Flow is designed for iteration. Make changes, test again, and refine. Indie can help you adjust and improve.

**Remember:** A playable prototype beats a perfect design document. Test early, test often.

## Congratulations!

You've created your first BMGD project! You now have:

- A game concept with a defined core mechanic
- A prototype specification ready for implementation
- Experience using BMGD's Quick Flow workflow
